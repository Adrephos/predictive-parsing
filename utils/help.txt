Syntax Analysis - Help

Syntax Analysis is a tool for parsing context-free languages using top-down and bottom-up parsing algorithms. It supports LL(1) and LR(0) grammars

Usage

To use this tool, you can run the following commands:

- `./syntax-analysis`: Executes the program and allows for manual input of grammar rules and strings to parse
- `./syntax-analysis -f <file>`: Parses the grammar rules and strings from a file specified by `<file>`
- `./syntax-analysis -g <int>`: Generates a random grammar for testing purposes and a number of strings given by `<int>`
- `./syntax-analysis -h`: Displays this help message

Notes

- The top-down parser is designed for LL(1) grammars
- The bottom-up parser is designed for LR(0) grammars
